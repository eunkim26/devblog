## Tl;DR

Users who trained with the games improved regardless of age in terms of scores and processing speed throughout the 100 sessions, suggesting that old and very old adults can improve their cognitive performance using CMG in real-life use.

## Introduction

---

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world population aged over 60 years will have doubled in number by 2050, with an estimated total of 2 billion people. `WHO.Ageing and Health(WHO,2018)`

Currently it is estimated that 50 million are living with dementia worldwide and nearly 10 million new cases occur every year, representing a serious public health problem

dementia is not considered a normal sequela of aging and prevention should be the key strategy to mitigate the identified risk factors

In cognitively healthy people aged 65 or older, there was some evidence from the included studies to suggest that 12 or more weeks of computerized cognitive training may improve cognition

Processing speed training resulted in reduced dementia risk (hazard ratio 0.71 (95% CI 0.50–0.99), p = 0.049) compared to control, but memory and reasoning training generated no significant risk reduction (HR 0.79 (0.57–1.11), p = 0.18 and HR 0.79 (0.56–1.10), p = 0.16, respectively)

Previous studies have suggested a beneficial effect of structured cognitive training using commercially avail- able applications in healthy older adults

the main objective of our study is to add to the current knowledge by evaluating the efficacy of 100 sessions of CMG used in real-life (independently and without specific guidelines on training frequency) in older adults and how the effect may vary as a function of age.

## Results

---

### Time needed to perform all sessions

Statistically significant differences were observed for the different CMG (p<0.001) and within the CMG for the different age groups for Memory Sweep (p = 0.013), Babble Bots (p < 0.001) and Unique (p < 0.001).

### CMG Scores

As for the initial scores, we observed an interesting linear trend between age and session, indicating that all participants improved in all CMG but that the progress was slower in older participants (p < 0.001 for the 7 CMG).

### Processing Speed

For Word Pairs we observed an decrease in the processing speed in all age groups. For Square Numbers, Unique and Rush Back there was a statistically significant increase for all participant age groups, however as for the score, the increase of the processing speed is more marked for younger participants. For Must Sort, only participants aged 70 and over presented a decrease in processing speed while the other age groups presented a slight increase, but in both cases the magnitude was relatively small

## Discussion

---

we showed that CMG scores are correlated with the cognitive abilities of older adults with and without cognitive impairments.

aging is indeed related to a decrease in cognitive function and an increase in reaction time

...and that deficits may be associated with MCI

Though the changes in different cognitive abilities over the lifespan are relatively well-documented , there is less evidence on the plasticity of these different cognitive functions across the lifespan23–25. Furthermore, it has not yet been established whether all cognitive functions can be trained or the extent to which progress can be achieved in healthy subjects of different ages

Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to modify its structure and function for example under conditions of learning or compensation. We studied a healthy population and therefore the observed improvements are most likely due to training-induced plasticity rather than compensation. Previous studies have shown neuroimaging and neurotransmitter changes after cognitive training of working memory in healthy people27–29, that could ultimately lead to an increase of cognitive reserve

Cognitive training or sustained engagement in challenging novel tasks like CMGs could enhance the development
of scaffolding and as a result, confer protection and improvement in cognitive functions

even if the age-related cognitive decline is inevitable, lifelong trajectories of brain and cognitive functions are variable and stay plastic throughout the lifespan
