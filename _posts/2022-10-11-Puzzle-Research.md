> Reference: Pillai et al. 2011. `Association of Crossword Puzzle Participation with Memory Decline in Persons Who Develop Dementia`

## Tl;DR

Participation in cognitively stimulating leisure activities such as crossword puzzles may delay onset of the memory decline in the preclinical stages of dementia, possibly via its effect on improving cognitive reserve. Our findings show that late life crossword puzzle participation, independent of education, was associated with delayed onset of memory decline in persons who developed dementia. Given the wide availability and accessibility of crossword puzzles, their role in preventing cognitive decline should be validated in future clinical trials.

## Introduction

---

The rapid graying of the U.S. population and the attendant increase in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) has heightened public and scientific interest in identifying ways to maintain cognitive vitality and prevent the onset of dementia. Cognitively stimulating leisure activities have been reported to be associated with reduced risk of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) syndromes. `(Verghese, Lipton, et al.,2003;Verghese et al.,2006)`

Crossword puzzles might reduce risk of cognitive decline via their effect on improving cognitive reserve, direct disease modification effects, or they may be a marker for other healthy behaviors. `(Verghese, Lipton, et al., 2003; Verghese et al.,2006)`

Herein, we analyzed if participation in crossword puzzles affected the trajectory of memory decline in 101 Bronx Aging Study (BAS) participants who ultimately developed dementia. Specifically, we use change point models to ascertain whether the onset of accelerated memory decline (the change point) was delayed in crossword puzzle players and how the rate of memory decline after the change point was affected `(Hall et al., 2009)`

### Study Population

The Bronx Aging Study cohort included 488 healthy community-dwelling individual volunteers living in Bronx County, New York, enrolled between 1980 and 1983.

The study enrolled English-speaking subjects between 75 and 85 years of age. Exclusion criteria included previous diagnoses of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, liver disease, alcoholism, or known terminal illness; severe visual and hearing impairment interfering with completion of neuropsychological tests; and presence of dementia. The inception cohort was middle class, 90% white, and 64.5% women. This analysis includes 101 study participants who were cognitively normal at baseline, reported their formal education and participation in leisure activities at baseline, and developed incident dementia during follow-up.

### Cognitive Evaluation

As for the initial scores, we observed an interesting linear trend between age and session, indicating that all participants improved in all CMG but that the progress was slower in older participants (p < 0.001 for the 7 CMG).
