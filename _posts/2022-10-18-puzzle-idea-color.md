- Cast light into the essential operations of cognition, thereby offering clues to fundamental cognitive processes and their neuro-cognitive architecture.

- **How to do it:** Clicking the one that matches the written name of a color and its actual color

### Relationship between stroop effect and cognitive impairment

>Reference: Esther Heerema, 2019, `How the Stroop Test Screens for Signs of Early Alzheimer's`

- This screening test can often identify mild cognitive impairment

It may be used as part of the assessment process when conducting an evaluation to determine if someone has mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s, or another type of dementia.

The Stroop test is considered by some to be an effective measure of executive functioning—the ability to plan, apply knowledge and make decisions.

#### Stroop Test results

Older adults who do not have any cognitive impairment have, on average, a slower response time than younger and middle-aged adults, but they typically answer the questions correctly.

People with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s or another dementia, on the other hand, will be slower in answering but also will have a significantly higher rate of incorrect answers because of their decline in processing information and the inability to ignore one stimulus (the word) while focusing on the other one (the color).

The test has been administered across several languages and consistently been shown to be effective in identifying executive functioning impairments.

- **Instructions:** As one solves the sudoku the hue blocks are filled according to the gradient

### Sudoku's impact on brain health

>Reference: Ashlesh et al. 2020 `Role of prefrontal cortex during Sudoku task: fNIRS study`

#### Background

Sudoku is a popular cognitively stimulating leisure-time activity. Many studies have been directed toward finding an algorithm to solve Sudoku, but the investigation of the neural substrates involved in Sudoku has been challenging.

Sudoku is a good cognitively stimulating leisure-time activity. Sudoku requires attention of the subject to analyze the grids and fill in the numbers; basically it requires no math but is based on logic. Solving puzzles has long been thought to keep the brain healthy and has been shown to delay the onset of dementia.

#### Results

Post hoc analysis showed a significant increase in oxyhemoglobin concentrations and decrease in deoxyhemoglobin concentrations at all 16 optode locations during step 1 (3 × 3 subgrids) and step 2 (easy level 9 × 9 Sudoku) when compared with the rest (p < 0.0001). Contrasting the step 2 – step 1 revealed that medial regions of PFC were preferentially activated.

#### Conclusion

Both the medial and lateral regions of PFC are activated during Sudoku task. However, the medial regions of PFC play a differential role, especially when we consider searching and selecting the heuristic rules. Thus, Sudoku may be used for cognitive remediation training in neuropsychiatric disorders involving PFC.
